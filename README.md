# Ethereum.net

Outline:

STACK: HMTL/CSS/JS(AngularJS)/Python(Flask)/PostresSQL

Front End - HTML/CSS - can be done with some prexisting theme, (I will take care of this)

Front End - JS - Will need to decide on which framework to use. AngularJS is a hit, would be wise to use this. Scope of using it would be animation and user interface desing, NOT advanced clientside key generation and the like.

Scope: 

Godaddy like registrar with...

1. Homepage - Landing Page
2. Login (Will be done with Flask, passwords logged in PostgresSQL)
3. Internal Homepage (After logged in)
4. Domain Registry (interface with Ethereum)
5. List of owned domain lists
